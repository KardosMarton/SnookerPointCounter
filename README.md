# SnookerPointCounter
Snooker point counter allpication.

This application helps to count the state of a snooker game. 
You don't need to count the values of the snooker balls, 
just select which was spotted and the app will show how many
points you have.

At the begining type both player's name, set how many frames
you want to play in the middle of the point counters line (0)
just by touching it.
Select which player shoots and just touch the ball which was
potted. The buttons on the edges helps if one of the player
makes a mistake, win the frame or you accidentally pressed
a wrong button/ball.

At the bottom you can see the potted ball statistic.
